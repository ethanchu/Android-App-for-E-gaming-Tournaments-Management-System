# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 07

## 1 Introduction

TourneyManager is an Android app built to give event organizers a simple way to manage
8 and 16 player tournaments. TourneyManager gives the host a simple way to view total prizes 
collected and paid out, as well as a history of each player's winnings. It will also allow
tournament patrons to view their winnings in all of the tournaments they have participated in.

## 2 Process Description


Should actually be development cycle processes.
"Gather Requirements > Create Test Plan > Development > Testing/Verification > Delivery"?
Could

yea and then i think we can split those into somewhat parallel tasks based on
classes / functionality like we can maybe say the managementsystem and tournament
classes need to be somewhat developed together where the user class can just be a
placeholder as far as that development goes (its mostly just pointers to User objects
in management / tournament) where the User and Player System development may need to be
closer together
