# User Manual

Tourney Manager is an application to help you more easily manage tournaments from your Android
device without needing a laptop or an internet connection.
 
## Usage
Upon first starting the app, you will be presented with the option to choose to view the
manager's view or the players view. Each of these views will be detailed more in depth below,
however in short the manager of the tournament should select the manager option, and any
player can select the other.


### Manager Mode

The manager mode allows a tournament manager to create and maintain 8 or 16 player single
elimination tournaments, as well as maintain information about any player that has participated
in any tournaments at the location.

The main screen of manager mode varies depending on if there is an active tournament or not.
While both scenarios allow the manager to create new players, one mode will present the
option of creating a tournament and the other will show management options.


#### Inactive Tournament Options

If a tournament is not active, the manager will be able to create players and tournaments
as well as view a list of players and all house profits earned from each tournament. Unlike
the player's view of the list of players, the manager's list will allow the manager to
select a player and view more detailed information about their wins/losses.

To create a tournament, you will be required to select either 8 or 16 players exactly.


#### Active Tournament Options

On the other hand, if a tournament is active then you will be presented with the option to
end a tournament early and complete a match.


### Player mode

The player mode does not allow the user to create or modify any information in the system.
The player's only options are to view a list of players if there is no tournament active,
or view a list of past, current, and the next round of matches.
